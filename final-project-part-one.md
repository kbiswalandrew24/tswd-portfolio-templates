# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
At the heart of this project is a conversation about the escalating trend of food prices worldwide, with a focus on understanding how this impacts individuals and families, particularly in the United States and Pittsburgh. Through our discussion, we aim to convey the challenges many face in affording a healthy diet due to these rising prices. We'll explore who bears the brunt of these increases and delve into the realities of food affordability. Ultimately, this is a story about the struggles and triumphs of everyday people trying to navigate a landscape where nutritious food is becoming increasingly out of reach for many. One actionable step could be extending a helping hand to those in need by donating to food assistance programs or volunteering with local initiatives aimed at combating food insecurity. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in ensuring no one goes hungry in our communities.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

We will start with an Introduction which discusses the main focus of the discussion: understanding the impact of food price increases on access to healthy food.
