# Outline
 
At the heart of this project is a conversation about the escalating trend of food prices worldwide, with a focus on understanding how this impacts individuals and families, particularly in the United States and Pittsburgh. Through our discussion, we aim to convey the challenges many face in affording a healthy diet due to these rising prices. We'll explore who bears the brunt of these increases and delve into the realities of food affordability. Ultimately, this is a story about the struggles and triumphs of everyday people trying to navigate a landscape where nutritious food is becoming increasingly out of reach for many. One actionable step could be extending a helping hand to those in need by donating to food assistance programs or volunteering with local initiatives aimed at combating food insecurity. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in ensuring no one goes hungry in our communities.
