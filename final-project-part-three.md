# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II. 

Transitioning from Part 2 to the final chapter proved to be a nuanced journey, presenting its unique set of challenges as I navigated the realms of data visualization, story writing, and user feedback. Crafting a cohesive narrative demanded a meticulous approach, requiring me to refine and enhance each element to ensure a seamless integration. In Part 3, titled "The Evolution Unveiled," user feedback served as the heartbeat of the project, acting as a guiding compass for the grand finale.

The exploration began with a careful consideration of background media files. Seeking alternatives that resonated with the project's overarching theme, I aimed to immerse the audience in a visual panorama of global food affordability. The narrative's visual cornerstone, the CPI Index Diagram, underwent a deliberate metamorphosis. Striving for heightened clarity and engagement, the visualization approach shifted to a uniform color pattern, offering the audience a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing journey through the intricate data.

A pivotal addition to this culminating chapter was the strategic incorporation of a Call to Action. Positioned thoughtfully on the shorthand page, this element goes beyond a mere invitation to absorb data. Instead, it encourages readers to reflect on their individual roles in addressing the pressing global challenge of food affordability, urging them to become active participants in the ongoing narrative of change.

Refinement extended to the Overview and Introduction sections, where superfluous content was carefully removed to streamline the narrative's flow. Recognizing instances where context was lacking amidst the data, I interwove a layer of content to ensure that every piece served a purpose, contributing to the painting of a comprehensive and nuanced picture. The result is a narrative that not only informs but invites readers to introspect and actively engage in the collective endeavor of addressing the complex issues surrounding global food affordability.

To enhance clarity about the Consumer Price Index (CPI), I included a brief explanation, considering that not everyone may be familiar with this economic indicator. Additionally, due to technical constraints during presentation, I opted to present the data as images on shorthand. Responding to valuable feedback, I incorporated the data source for each visualization below the title, and links to the Tableau Public were provided at the end of each viz for reference. Each text portion also carries a clear reference at the bottom, contributing to transparency and credibility in conveying this impactful narrative.


## The audience

I want this story to connect with everyone, not just a specific group. The responsibility to tackle global challenges like food price inflation and wastage is something we all share, regardless of our backgrounds. Even though I interviewed students, the insights apply to everyone. The title reflects this inclusivity, inviting people from different walks of life to join the conversation about our shared duty to reduce food wastage and understand the complexities of food price inflation. Together, we can build a more informed, aware, and proactive community, working towards sustainable solutions.
## Final design decisions
In Part 2, the major challenge revolved around the Consumer Price Index (CPI) graph, which was both massive and unclear. Recognizing the need for a user-friendly replacement, I made a deliberate effort to introduce a more intuitive visualization in Part 3. Simultaneously, I aimed to provide context on CPI for users who might not be familiar with the term. Addressing another concern, I ensured uniformity in graph patterns by adopting a green-gold format, enhancing visual cohesion. Additionally, I incorporated specific data sources for each graph to bolster transparency. Emphasizing the importance of references, I provided clear attributions for every piece of text referenced in the narrative. All data references were consolidated at the bottom of the page, promoting clarity. To facilitate further exploration, I included links to Tableau Public for a detailed look at the data visualizations. These refinements collectively contribute to a more user-friendly, transparent, and credible presentation in Part 3.

# Final thoughts
In reflecting on the overall process, navigating from Part 2 to the final chapter presented a dynamic and iterative journey. The challenges posed by the CPI Index graph in Part 2 served as a catalyst for significant improvements in Part 3, where a more user-friendly and intuitive visualization was introduced. The decision to provide context on CPI, ensuring uniformity in color schemes, and replacing media files with relevant visuals were strategic choices aimed at enhancing user experience and engagement.

The addition of a Call to Action section was a pivotal moment, as it encouraged users not only to absorb information but to actively reflect on their role in addressing global challenges. Incorporating references and specific data sources for each visualization aimed at elevating transparency and credibility.

Reflecting on the presentation, the overall execution went smoothly; however, time constraints posed challenges in presenting data, leading to the use of images on shorthand. In hindsight, there's a desire to revisit this aspect, exploring alternative solutions for a more seamless user experience. The feedback received emphasized the importance of clearer background media files, indicating a need for revisions to better align with the overarching theme. One notable issue encountered was the difficulty in loading data visualizations, and addressing this technical glitch would have significantly enhanced the audience's engagement and understanding.
The journey unfolded as a captivating learning experience, with clarity emerging at every step. Initially unfamiliar with shorthand, the process led to an exploration of various data visualization tools and techniques. The thrill reached its peak during the data collection phase, piecing together fragments of information to construct a narrative. Building a story out of diverse data sets and then presenting it was a major highlight, adding a sense of accomplishment to the entire journey.
