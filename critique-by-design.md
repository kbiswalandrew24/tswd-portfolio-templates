# Make Over Monday
# What is the demand for cocoa on the European market?
Welcome to the crique board of Make Over Monday assignment. I have choosen the topic: 
# Global Import of cocoa beans.
## And here the link for it: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w52 (1)

## A brief observation about the article: 
After reviewing the article, it seems like it's mainly aimed at folks involved in the cocoa beans trade or connected to the cocoa industry in some way. The article highlights Europe's significant role in the cocoa business and gives insights into which parts of Europe are more active compared to others.

However, there are a few areas where improvements could be made. The use of too many colors in the data representation can be distracting, and some sections present data in long paragraphs instead of using visuals, which might make it harder for readers to focus.

For instance, when discussing Europe's status as the world's largest chocolate producer, it would have been helpful to include stats to support this claim. Also, when talking about Europe's high demand for cocoa beans, a trend graph showing the market's recovery post-COVID could have been more engaging. Similarly, mentioning that Ivory Coast was the largest cocoa grinder in a certain year, but not representing this well in the treemap, could be confusing.

Additionally, while the article mentions details like per capita chocolate consumption, it lacks visual representation for this data. The pie chart provided to justify Europe's appeal for specialty and bulk cocoa might not be very relatable, and it doesn't explain how the percentages were calculated.

Overall, while the article's content may be understandable to the general public, it might not engage them as much as those in the cocoa industry. Improving the visualizations, like choosing colors wisely or minimally and more effective charts, could make the data more accessible and engaging to a wider audience


## Section 3: Wire Framing the solution as part of the critique
Initially, when examining the bar graphs provided in this article, I considered simplifying them to effectively convey the message that Europe serves as the primary global market for cocoa beans. 
There are multiple graphs and a lot of context that is present with very detailed explanation about the same. Few things I liked and few I would like to have a modification in the view.

For the first figure:
This gives us details about the different regions that are playing a role in global imports. And this is how it was:
![image](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/0b89098f-fa6d-4024-9da1-35d4f157db81)

This graph has the details of the regions provided for each year through 2017 to 2021. But the multiple color present on the graph increases eye travelling and fails to give us the exact details it is supposed to. Hence I thought of simplyfying the graph to show the sum of imports for each region for these 5 years and this is how it looked.![Fig1](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/0178f138-d5e9-4dfa-b0fe-3b592ec4c2ee)

This graph helps to project that Eupore is the highest importer of cocoa throughout the year 2017 to 2021. 

In the same article, there was another figure presenting details regarding the percentage of estimated cocoa bean grinding for the years 2020 and 2021, categorized by country within each region. The article discusses Europe's recovery from the effects of COVID-19 and its positive trend in increasing the percentage of cocoa bean grinding. However, it lacks detailed data regarding the countries mentioned in the graph in terms of tonnage or historical data from previous years, which would have facilitated the creation of a trend graph. Such a graph could have effectively conveyed to the audience that the cocoa bean market is growing in Europe. Unfortunately, this figure fails to align with a statement in the article indicating that "Ivory Coast was the world’s largest cocoa grinder in 2020/2021, with 620 thousand tonnes, followed by the Netherlands, with a cocoa grinding volume of 610 thousand tonnes." Therefore, the percentage values do not clearly indicate the ranking of the highest contributors to cocoa grinding for the year 2020/2021. Below is the given representation for that:

![image](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/6ae2ee83-602a-49e9-9be1-e2c6646a7b21)
In my attempt of initial improvemnt to this graph, this is what i made:
![Fig 2](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/e3c64748-cecf-47c1-97ca-50ed24613f1e)

![image](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/1050babb-528d-442f-8c06-f0b83926af39)

There was another section "Countries with the highest per-capita chocolate consumption in Europe" - which was telling us about the per capita consumption of chocolate in europe in a text format. I beleive instead of text this could have been repesented as a table or in a bar graph which will help the audience to grab the info in a quick manner as compared to the text or paragraph. Below is the bar graph for the same:
![Chocolate_consumption](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/b19b30df-0bc6-4b17-ad46-54fd1b8c2e80)

Another section which i came across which was talking about how Europe is an interesting outlet for both bulk and specialty cocoa: This section gives an insight for the countries who are playing a lead role in supplying cocoa to European countries. And in this article it has been represented as a pie chart. The diagram is below: ![image](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/dcbd10f7-c5c7-4e1e-9219-a7b2b485c9e0). 

While this provides insights for each country's contribution in percentage, it can confuse the audience by presenting too many details and colors. Therefore, thought to redesign the graph has come across and this how it looks:
![Fig  3](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/9e0e103b-fc67-47b3-8f03-15615c0c75b9) 
This graph helps to gives us a clear idea that 39% is the highest supplier of cocoa in europe. But it misses one information and that is the labels for each bar.(received a comment for this in review process). 

In the section:
## Which European markets offer most opportunities for cocoa?

This section offers insight into which market presents the most opportunities for cocoa. The graph provided below is followed by the revised version.

![image](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/df4a5a58-e26f-4028-a6cd-da51a1eb05e4)

And the initial version of re defined data visualtion is as below: 
![Fig 4](https://github.com/kbiswalandrew24/tswd-portfolio-templates/assets/144747918/ca4f5719-2f73-4086-b129-ec5d0acbfeef)
Although the two are bar graphs, but the first graph shows data per year, where the year are representing the colors, hence ending up in a situation similar to fig. 1. Too many colors leads to more eye travelling and getting confused on where to focus. Tried to resolve these in the initial redesign, by stacking up the colors(year) and the single bar will represent the country giving a clearer picture of netherland having the top position as the importer through these 5 years(2017 to 2021).

# Section 4- Review process 
Once I had my initial draft version ready I went for the initial review and had asked 2 person along with that had a in class critique/review by a friend too. And this is how it looked like: 

**Person 1:**
- Can you tell me what you think this is?-Data related to cocoa bean and euporean market around it
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?- details of cocoa imports in European market
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?- the audience(who is it intended to)
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?-any business related to this
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?- the representation of data
-Any Feedback/suggestions for improvement- For the first graph, change the title to more contextual. Liked the color representation for the graph.Fig.2 redesign is better than the original as it is more clear in description. Use of color gradient is what makes more sense. For fig 3, put the label, as it is not clear what is the largest % refer to, which country. And for fig 4 redesign, a pie chart can also be considered.

**Person2:** 
- Can you tell me what you think this is?- European market for cocoa import
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?- opportunity for cocoa market 
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?-No
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?- cocoa dealers
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?-  instead of summing it up and showcasing it, if possible, try any other way. Because it is simply taking away the granularity of the bar graph. And if possible re-doing the data representation for all figure 1, 2,3,4.

Take Away from the Review: 
-Try to represent the figures in a better way as these are not the optimal version of representation as compared to the versions given for fig. 1,2,3,4.
- Add labels where necessary or missed for better understanding
- represent the data in a more better way, without taking away the granularity of it.

# Final Version of Data representation:
For the final version, the graphs has been recreated using tableau.

## Fig 1(Global Imports of Cocoa beans per region)
For Fig.1 (Highest Importers of COCOA through years 2017 to 2021)- given as Bar Graph initially in the article. 
I have tried to re create the chart using bubble chart. And this is how it looks:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707330723839' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Highest Exporters of cocoa  ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;HI&#47;HIghest_exportersOfCOCOA&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='HIghest_exportersOfCOCOA&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;HI&#47;HIghest_exportersOfCOCOA&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-GB' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707330723839');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>


From the graph the message is that Europe has been the highest exporter of cocoa through 2017 to 2021. 
### Reason for choosing this pattern:
Since the bar graph had too many colors, which made it hard to focus, I decided to try a different approach as it representing it with same details but in a way which will be able to tell the audience in a glance that "this is the country which has done highest imports through these years". 
When I compare this new version to my initial design, I notice that the first one was simpler and got straight to the point that europe is the country which has to be focused on for this purpose, but it didn't show all the details through out the years as in each year who has the highest number of imports . However, this new version gives me a different perspective, showing more details about each each who has the highest number of imports.
For example, the bigger circles represent Europe, which was the largest exporter from 2017 to 2021, The bigger circle grabs the attention of audience along with color that is implemented to it for the purpose.
During this process of choosing, I experimented with various representation methods, including bar graphs, line graphs, square graphs, area graphs, and more. However, this particular representation convinced me the most compared to the others.

## Figure 2( cocoa bean grinding by region and country in % of the world’s total, 2020/2021)
Regarding Figure 2, we are talking about the cocoa bean grinding by each region and country. it gives us details about how much % of beans are getting grounded which gives a details for the people will be interested in the market. 
Now the graph : Depicted as a tree map, it showcases the countries in each region involved in cocoa grinding for the year 2020/2021. While aiming to maintain the clarity of regional contributions without compromising the overall representation, I opted for a monochrome color palette. This choice helps to draw the audience's attention, with the darkest shade highlighting the major contributions and the lighter shades indicating lesser contributions. And this is how it looks:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707329972521' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='% cocoa grinding by region and country - 2020&#47;2021 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;co&#47;cocoa_grinding_byregion&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='cocoa_grinding_byregion&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;co&#47;cocoa_grinding_byregion&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707329972521');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

# Reason why choose this pattern:
Now, explaining why I opted for this graph—I experimented with line graphs, square graphs, and bubble graphs, but they didn't convince me that they would be easily understood by the target audience. Therefore, I settled on this graph as it uses colors and labels to clearly indicate which region has the highest cocoa grinding. It divides the regions with details of country names and percentages, effectively conveying the story to the audience.

## Figure 3(Cocoa Suppliers in Europe)
Figure 3: This depiction is in the form of a pie chart containing numerous details, including percentage values for the main supplier countries to Europe for cocoa beans.This info might be helpful to people who deals with or have any connection with the trading of cocoa. While the pie chart appears colorful, it contains an abundance of information. Therefore, to preserve the details while presenting the data in a manner that does not confuse or distract the audience, I have tried to represent the data using tableau as below trying to deliver the message to the audience.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707330228679' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Suppliers of Cocoa in Europe ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Su&#47;SuppliersOfCocoaInEurope&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='SuppliersOfCocoaInEurope&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Su&#47;SuppliersOfCocoaInEurope&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707330228679');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

### Reason for choosing this approach:
This approach allows me to maintain the details while effectively communicating the message to the user that Ivory Coast is the largest cocoa supplier. When you view this diagram, the tallest lollipop immediately grabs your attention, and the label at the bottom clearly identifies the country. Similarly, other lollipops provide the relevant data, ensuring that the details are conveyed without causing distraction or confusion.

## Figure 4(Top Importers of cocoa in Europian countries)
Figure 4: This figure had details of the cocoa importers, segregated into each country, the bar graph was presented in multiple colors, each country section having data for 5 individual years 2017 to 2021. Each year represents one color. The graph looks colorful but if I try to convey the message in a better way then this is what I have tried to do.

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707330300384' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Largest Cocoa Importers in Europe (Tons) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;co&#47;cocoa_importers_in_europe&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='cocoa_importers_in_europe&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;co&#47;cocoa_importers_in_europe&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707330300384');
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

### Reason for choosing this approach:
Now, why did I select this graph over others? I experimented with various graph designs, but the line graph or the area graph couldn't effectively convey the detailed narrative about the largest cocoa importing countries with quantity and year combined. However, I discovered this graph, which presents everything at once, indicating the countries, their respective quantities, and the corresponding years. Additionally, the color scheme enhances the emphasis on details, with color Red instantly drawing attention, while the other colors in the palette help to maintain audience focus. When comparing this to my initial stacked bar design, this new approach provides deeper insights into the details of the top cocoa importers in Europe from 2017 to 2021.


Note: While in the process of redigning the graphs, I tried other pattern of graphs for each of the figure, but some how the other figures did not fit to give me the details, or the pattern was not convincing enough that they would be a better design (as compared to the one's given on the article)for explaining to the audience the data we want to show or the story we want to tell. 
2. Have inclued all the graphs that were part of the initial design
