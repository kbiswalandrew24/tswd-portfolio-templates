# Wireframes / storyboards
My narrative delves into the intricate dynamics of global food prices and the consequential inflation, shedding light on the profound impact on people's lives. The overarching theme explores the poignant reality that a substantial portion of the world's population struggles to afford a healthy diet, accentuating the disparities in access to nutrition. Concurrently, my story unravels the paradox of widespread food wastage, where individuals are often oblivious to the stark contrast between their affluence and the scarcity faced by others.

As we navigate through the layers of this narrative, a spotlight is cast on the role of the United States in contributing to the global issue of food wastage. A closer examination reveals the nuanced trends in Pittsburgh, providing a microcosmic view of how these challenges manifest in a specific locality over the past few years.

Amidst these intricate details, the story weaves in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a key indicator, offering insights into the economic landscape and the trends that have shaped the affordability of goods and services for individuals over the specified timeframe. In essence, the narrative aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted aspects surrounding global food prices, their consequences, and the evolving patterns in both consumption and wastage.
